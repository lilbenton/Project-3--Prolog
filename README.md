## Description

 A Prolog program that  tells  us  how  to  get  from  one room of a one-story building, to any other room in that building (if itâ€™s possible), by telling us all of the rooms we must go through to get to the destination room. There will be phones ringing in one or more of the rooms. It only tell us how to get to those rooms. If we attempt to go to a room that does not have a ringing phone, the program does not produce any output.
 
 My computer refused to download the suggested IDEs for this project, not matter what I tried. I looked up other suggested platforms I could code from and I got TextMate. I am unsure how sufficient it will be on the others.
